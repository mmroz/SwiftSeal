 @class ASLBigUInt
 
 @brief The ASLBigUInt class and wrapper for biguint
 
 @discussion Represents an unsigned integer with a specified bit width.
 Represents an unsigned integer with a specified bit width. Non-const
 BigUInts are mutable and able to be resized. The bit count for a BigUInt
 (which can be read with bit_count()) is set initially by the constructor
 and can be resized either explicitly with the resize() function or
 implicitly with an assignment operation (e.g., operator=(), operator+=(),
 etc.). A rich set of unsigned integer operations are provided by the
 BigUInt class, including comparison, traditional arithmetic (addition,
 subtraction, multiplication, division), and modular arithmetic functions.
 
 Backing Array
 The backing array for a BigUInt stores its unsigned integer value as
 a contiguous std::uint64_t array. Each std::uint64_t in the array
 sequentially represents 64-bits of the integer value, with the least
 significant quad-word storing the lower 64-bits and the order of the bits
 for each quad word dependent on the architecture's std::uint64_t
 representation. The size of the array equals the bit count of the BigUInt
 (which can be read with bit_count()) rounded up to the next std::uint64_t
 boundary (i.e., rounded up to the next 64-bit boundary). The uint64_count()
 function returns the number of std::uint64_t in the backing array. The
 data() function returns a pointer to the first std::uint64_t in the array.
 Additionally, the operator [] function allows accessing the individual
 bytes of the integer value in a platform-independent way - for example,
 reading the third byte will always return bits 16-24 of the BigUInt value
 regardless of the platform being little-endian or big-endian.
 
 Implicit Resizing
 Both the copy constructor and operator=() allocate more memory for the
 backing array when needed, i.e. when the source BigUInt has a larger
 backing array than the destination. Conversely, when the destination
 backing array is already large enough, the data is only copied and the
 unnecessary higher order bits are set to zero. When new memory has to be
 allocated, only the significant bits of the source BigUInt are taken
 into account. This is is important, because it avoids unnecessary zero
 bits to be included in the destination, which in some cases could
 accumulate and result in very large unnecessary allocations. However,
 sometimes it is necessary to preserve the original size, even if some
 of the leading bits are zero. For this purpose BigUInt contains functions
 duplicate_from and duplicate_to, which create an exact copy of the source
 BigUInt.
 
 Alias BigUInts
 An aliased BigUInt (which can be determined with is_alias()) is a special
 type of BigUInt that does not manage its underlying std::uint64_t pointer
 used to store the value. An aliased BigUInt supports most of the same
 operations as a non-aliased BigUInt, including reading and writing the
 value, however an aliased BigUInt does not internally allocate or
 deallocate its backing array and, therefore, does not support resizing.
 Any attempt, either explicitly or implicitly, to resize the BigUInt will
 result in an exception being thrown. An aliased BigUInt can be created
 with the BigUInt(int, std::uint64_t*) constructor or the alias() function.
 Note that the pointer specified to be aliased must be deallocated
 externally after the BigUInt is no longer in use. Aliasing is useful in
 cases where it is desirable to not have each BigUInt manage its own memory
 allocation and/or to prevent unnecessary copying.
 
 Thread Safety
 In general, reading a BigUInt is thread-safe while mutating is not.
 Specifically, the backing array may be freed whenever a resize occurs,
 the BigUInt is destroyed, or alias() is called, which would invalidate
 the address returned by data() and the byte references returned by
 operator []. When it is known that a resize will not occur, concurrent
 reading and mutating will not inherently fail but it is possible for
 a read to see a partially updated value from a concurrent write.
 A non-aliased BigUInt allocates its backing array from the global
 (thread-safe) memory pool. Consequently, creating or resizing a large
 number of BigUInt can result in a performance loss due to thread
 contention.
