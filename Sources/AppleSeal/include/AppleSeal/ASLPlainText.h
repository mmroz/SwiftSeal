 @class ASLPlainText
 
 @brief The ASLPlainText class and wrapper for the seal::PlainText
 
 @discussion Class to store ASLPlainText.
 
 Class to store a plaintext element. The data for the plaintext is a polynomial
 with coefficients modulo the plaintext modulus. The degree of the plaintext
 polynomial must be one less than the degree of the polynomial modulus. The
 backing array always allocates one 64-bit word per each coefficient of the
 polynomial.
 
 Memory Management
 The coefficient count of a plaintext refers to the number of word-size
 coefficients in the plaintext, whereas its capacity refers to the number of
 word-size coefficients that fit in the current memory allocation. In high-
 performance applications unnecessary re-allocations should be avoided by
 reserving enough memory for the plaintext to begin with either by providing
 the desired capacity to the constructor as an extra argument, or by calling
 the reserve function at any time.
 
 When the scheme is scheme_type::BFV each coefficient of a plaintext is a 64-bit
 word, but when the scheme is scheme_type::CKKS the plaintext is by default
 stored in an NTT transformed form with respect to each of the primes in the
 coefficient modulus. Thus, the size of the allocation that is needed is the
 size of the coefficient modulus (number of primes) times the degree of the
 polynomial modulus. In addition, a valid CKKS plaintext also store the parms_id
 for the corresponding encryption parameters.
 
 Thread Safety
 In general, reading from plaintext is thread-safe as long as no other thread
 is concurrently mutating it. This is due to the underlying data structure
 storing the plaintext not being thread-safe.
 
 @see Ciphertext for the class that stores ciphertexts.
