 @class ASLKSwitchKeys
 
 @brief The ASLKSwitchKeys class and wrapper for the  seal::KSwitchKeys
 
 @discussion Class to store seal::KSwitchKeys.
 
 Class to store keyswitching keys. It should never be necessary for normal
 users to create an instance of KSwitchKeys. This class is used strictly as
 a base class for RelinKeys and GaloisKeys classes.

 @par Keyswitching
 Concretely, keyswitching is used to change a ciphertext encrypted with one
 key to be encrypted with another key. It is a general technique and is used
 in relinearization and Galois rotations. A keyswitching key contains a sequence
 (vector) of keys. In RelinKeys, each key is an encryption of a power of the
 secret key. In GaloisKeys, each key corresponds to a type of rotation.

 @par Thread Safety
 In general, reading from KSwitchKeys is thread-safe as long as no
 other thread is concurrently mutating it. This is due to the underlying
 data structure storing the keyswitching keys not being thread-safe.

 @see RelinKeys for the class that stores the relinearization keys.
 @see GaloisKeys for the class that stores the Galois keys.
