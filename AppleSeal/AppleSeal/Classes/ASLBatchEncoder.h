 @class ASLBatchEncoder
 
 @brief The ASLBatchEncoder class and wrapper for batchencoder.h
 
 @discussion Provides functionality for CRT batching. If the polynomial modulus degree is N, and the plaintext modulus is a prime number T such that T is congruent to 1 modulo 2N,
 then BatchEncoder allows the plaintext elements to be viewed as 2-by-(N/2)
 matrices of integers modulo T. Homomorphic operations performed on such encrypted
 matrices are applied coefficient (slot) wise, enabling powerful SIMD functionality
 for computations that are vectorizable. This functionality is often called "batching"
 in the homomorphic encryption literature.
 
 Mathematical Background
 Mathematically speaking, if the polynomial modulus is X^N+1, N is a power of two, and
 plain_modulus is a prime number T such that 2N divides T-1, then integers modulo T
 contain a primitive 2N-th root of unity and the polynomial X^N+1 splits into n distinct
 linear factors as X^N+1 = (X-a_1)*...*(X-a_N) mod T, where the constants a_1, ..., a_n
 are all the distinct primitive 2N-th roots of unity in integers modulo T. The Chinese
 Remainder Theorem (CRT) states that the plaintext space Z_T[X]/(X^N+1) in this case is
 isomorphic (as an algebra) to the N-fold direct product of fields Z_T. The isomorphism
 is easy to compute explicitly in both directions, which is what this class does.
 Furthermore, the Galois group of the extension is (Z/2NZ)* ~= Z/2Z x Z/(N/2) whose
 action on the primitive roots of unity is easy to describe. Since the batching slots
 correspond 1-to-1 to the primitive roots of unity, applying Galois automorphisms on the
 plaintext act by permuting the slots. By applying generators of the two cyclic
 subgroups of the Galois group, we can effectively view the plaintext as a 2-by-(N/2)
 matrix, and enable cyclic row rotations, and column rotations (row swaps).
 
 Valid Parameters
 Whether batching can be used depends on whether the plaintext modulus has been chosen
 appropriately. Thus, to construct a BatchEncoder the user must provide an instance
 of SEALContext such that its associated EncryptionParameterQualifiers object has the
 flags parameters_set and enable_batching set to true.
