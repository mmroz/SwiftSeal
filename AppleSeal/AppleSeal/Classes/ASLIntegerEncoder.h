 @class ASLIntegerEncoder
 
 @brief The ASLIntegerEncoder class and wrapper for the  seal IntegerEncoder
 
 @discussion Encodes integers into plaintext polynomials that Encryptor can encrypt. An instance of
 the IntegerEncoder class converts an integer into a plaintext polynomial by placing its
 binary digits as the coefficients of the polynomial. Decoding the integer amounts to
 evaluating the plaintext polynomial at x=2.
 
 Addition and multiplication on the integer side translate into addition and multiplication
 on the encoded plaintext polynomial side, provided that the length of the polynomial
 never grows to be of the size of the polynomial modulus (poly_modulus), and that the
 coefficients of the plaintext polynomials appearing throughout the computations never
 experience coefficients larger than the plaintext modulus (plain_modulus).
 
 Negative Integers
 Negative integers are represented by using -1 instead of 1 in the binary representation,
 and the negative coefficients are stored in the plaintext polynomials as unsigned integers
 that represent them modulo the plaintext modulus. Thus, for example, a coefficient of -1
 would be stored as a polynomial coefficient plain_modulus-1.
