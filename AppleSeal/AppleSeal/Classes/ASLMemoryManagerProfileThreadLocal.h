@class ASLMemoryManagerProfileThreadLocal

@brief The ASLMemoryManagerProfileThreadLocal class and wrapper for the  seal::MMProfThreadLocal

@discussion Class to store seal::MMProfThreadLocal.

A memory manager profile that always returns a MemoryPoolHandle pointing to
the thread-local memory pool. This profile should be used with care, as any
memory allocated by it will be released once the thread exits. In other words,
the thread-local memory pool cannot be used to share memory across different
threads. On the other hand, this profile can be useful when a very high number
of threads doing simultaneous allocations would cause contention in the
global memory pool.
