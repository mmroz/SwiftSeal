 @class ASLEncryptionParameters
 
 @brief The ASLEncryptionParameters class and wrapper for EncryptionParameters
 
 @discussion Represents user-customizable encryption scheme settings. The parameters (most
 importantly poly_modulus, coeff_modulus, plain_modulus) significantly affect
 the performance, capabilities, and security of the encryption scheme. Once
 an instance of EncryptionParameters is populated with appropriate parameters,
 it can be used to create an instance of the SEALContext class, which verifies
 the validity of the parameters, and performs necessary pre-computations.
 
 Picking appropriate encryption parameters is essential to enable a particular
 application while balancing performance and security. Some encryption settings
 will not allow some inputs (e.g. attempting to encrypt a polynomial with more
 coefficients than poly_modulus or larger coefficients than plain_modulus) or,
 support the desired computations (with noise growing too fast due to too large
 plain_modulus and too small coeff_modulus).
 
 ASLParametersIdType
 The EncryptionParameters class maintains at all times a 256-bit hash of the
 currently set encryption parameters called the parms_id. This hash acts as
 a unique identifier of the encryption parameters and is used by all further
 objects created for these encryption parameters. The parms_id is not intended
 to be directly modified by the user but is used internally for pre-computation
 data lookup and input validity checks. In modulus switching the user can use
 the parms_id to keep track of the chain of encryption parameters. The parms_id
 is not exposed in the public API of EncryptionParameters, but can be accessed
 through the SEALContext::ContextData class once the SEALContext has been created.
 
 Thread Safety
 In general, reading from EncryptionParameters is thread-safe, while mutating
 is not.
 
 @warning Choosing inappropriate encryption parameters may lead to an encryption
 scheme that is not secure, does not perform well, and/or does not support the
 input and computation of the desired application. We highly recommend consulting
 an expert in RLWE-based encryption when selecting parameters, as this is where
 inexperienced users seem to most often make critical mistakes.
