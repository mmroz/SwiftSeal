         [IntegerEncoder] (For BFV scheme only)
         
         The IntegerEncoder encodes integers to BFV plaintext polynomials as follows.
         First, a binary expansion of the integer is computed. Next, a polynomial is
         created with the bits as coefficients. For example, the integer
         
         26 = 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^1
         
         is encoded as the polynomial 1x^4 + 1x^3 + 1x^1. Conversely, plaintext
         polynomials are decoded by evaluating them at x=2. For negative numbers the
         IntegerEncoder simply stores all coefficients as either 0 or -1, where -1 is
         represented by the unsigned integer PlainModulus - 1 in memory.
         
         Since encrypted computations operate on the polynomials rather than on the
         encoded integers themselves, the polynomial coefficients will grow in the
         course of such computations. For example, computing the sum of the encrypted
         encoded integer 26 with itself will result in an encrypted polynomial with
         larger coefficients: 2x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^1. Squaring the encrypted encoded
         integer 26 results also in increased coefficients due to cross-terms, namely,
         
         (1x^4 + 1x^3 + 1x^1)^2 = 1x^8 + 2x^7 + 1x^6 + 2x^5 + 2x^4 + 1x^2
         
         further computations will quickly increase the coefficients much more.
         Decoding will still work correctly in this case (evaluating the polynomial
         at x=2), but since the coefficients of plaintext polynomials are really
         integers modulo plain_modulus, implicit reduction modulo plain_modulus may
         yield unexpected results. For example, adding 1x^4 + 1x^3 + 1x^1 to itself
         plain_modulus many times will result in the constant polynomial 0, which is
         clearly not equal to 26 * plain_modulus. It can be difficult to predict when
         such overflow will take place especially when computing several sequential
         multiplications.
         
         The IntegerEncoder is easy to understand and use for simple computations,
         and can be a good tool to experiment with for usersto Microsoft SEAL.
         However, advanced users will probably prefer more efficient approaches,
         such as the BatchEncoder or the CKKSEncoder.
