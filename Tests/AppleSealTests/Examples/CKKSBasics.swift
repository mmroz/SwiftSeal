        on encrypted floating-point input data x for a set of 4096 equidistant points
        in the interval [0, 1]. This example demonstrates many of the main features
        of the CKKS scheme, but also the challenges in using it.
        We start by setting up the CKKS scheme.

        let parms = ASLEncryptionParameters(schemeType: .CKKS)

        /*
        We saw in `2_encoders.cpp' that multiplication in CKKS causes scales
        in ciphertexts to grow. The scale of any ciphertext must not get too close
        to the total size of coeff_modulus, or else the ciphertext simply runs out of
        room to store the scaled-up plaintext. The CKKS scheme provides a `rescale'
        functionality that can reduce the scale, and stabilize the scale expansion.
        Rescaling is a kind of modulus switch operation (recall `3_levels.cpp').
        As modulus switching, it removes the last of the primes from coeff_modulus,
        but as a side-effect it scales down the ciphertext by the removed prime.
        Usually we want to have perfect control over how the scales are changed,
        which is why for the CKKS scheme it is more common to use carefully selected
        primes for the coeff_modulus.
        More precisely, suppose that the scale in a CKKS ciphertext is S, and the
        last prime in the current coeff_modulus (for the ciphertext) is P. Rescaling
        to the next level changes the scale to S/P, and removes the prime P from the
        coeff_modulus, as usual in modulus switching. The number of primes limits
        how many rescalings can be done, and thus limits the multiplicative depth of
        the computation.
        It is possible to choose the initial scale freely. One good strategy can be
        to is to set the initial scale S and primes P_i in the coeff_modulus to be
        very close to each other. If ciphertexts have scale S before multiplication,
        they have scale S^2 after multiplication, and S^2/P_i after rescaling. If all
        P_i are close to S, then S^2/P_i is close to S again. This way we stabilize the
        scales to be close to S throughout the computation. Generally, for a circuit
        of depth D, we need to rescale D times, i.e., we need to be able to remove D
        primes from the coefficient modulus. Once we have only one prime left in the
        coeff_modulus, the remaining prime must be larger than S by a few bits to
        preserve the pre-decimal-point value of the plaintext.
        Therefore, a generally good strategy is to choose parameters for the CKKS
        scheme as follows:
            (1) Choose a 60-bit prime as the first prime in coeff_modulus. This will
                give the highest precision when decrypting;
            (2) Choose another 60-bit prime as the last element of coeff_modulus, as
                this will be used as the special prime and should be as large as the
                largest of the other primes;
            (3) Choose the intermediate primes to be close to each other.
        We use CoeffModulus::Create to generate primes of the appropriate size. Note
        that our coeff_modulus is 200 bits total, which is below the bound for our
        poly_modulus_degree: CoeffModulus::MaxBitCount(8192) returns 218.
        */

        /*
        We choose the initial scale to be 2^40. At the last level, this leaves us
        60-40=20 bits of precision before the decimal point, and enough (roughly
        10-20 bits) of precision after the decimal point. Since our intermediate
        primes are 40 bits (in fact, they are very close to 2^40), we can achieve
        scale stabilization as described above.

        scale the value of PI*x^3 by 2^120/(P_2^2*P_1), which is very close to 1.

        Another option would be to encode 1 with scale 2^80/P_2, do a multiply_plain

        make sure to encode 1 with appropriate encryption parameters (parms_id).
