         of the CKKS scheme, but also the challenges in using it.
         
         We start by setting up the CKKS scheme.

        let parms = ASLEncryptionParameters(schemeType: .CKKS)
        
        /*
         We saw in `2_Encoders.cs' that multiplication in CKKS causes scales in
         ciphertexts to grow. The scale of any ciphertext must not get too close to
         the total size of CoeffModulus, or else the ciphertext simply runs out of
         room to store the scaled-up plaintext. The CKKS scheme provides a `rescale'
         functionality that can reduce the scale, and stabilize the scale expansion.
         
         Rescaling is a kind of modulus switch operation (recall `3_Levels.cs').
         As modulus switching, it removes the last of the primes from CoeffModulus,
         but as a side-effect it scales down the ciphertext by the removed prime.
         Usually we want to have perfect control over how the scales are changed,
         which is why for the CKKS scheme it is more common to use carefully selected
         primes for the CoeffModulus.
         
         More precisely, suppose that the scale in a CKKS ciphertext is S, and the
         last prime in the current CoeffModulus (for the ciphertext) is P. Rescaling
         to the next level changes the scale to S/P, and removes the prime P from the
         CoeffModulus, as usual in modulus switching. The number of primes limits
         how many rescalings can be done, and thus limits the multiplicative depth of
         the computation.
         
         It is possible to choose the initial scale freely. One good strategy can be
         to is to set the initial scale S and primes P_i in the CoeffModulus to be
         very close to each other. If ciphertexts have scale S before multiplication,
         they have scale S^2 after multiplication, and S^2/P_i after rescaling. If all
         P_i are close to S, then S^2/P_i is close to S again. This way we stabilize the
         scales to be close to S throughout the computation. Generally, for a circuit
         of depth D, we need to rescale D times, i.e., we need to be able to remove D
         primes from the coefficient modulus. Once we have only one prime left in the
         coeff_modulus, the remaining prime must be larger than S by a few bits to
         preserve the pre-decimal-point value of the plaintext.
         
         Therefore, a generally good strategy is to choose parameters for the CKKS
         scheme as follows:
         
         (1) Choose a 60-bit prime as the first prime in CoeffModulus. This will
         give the highest precision when decrypting
         (2) Choose another 60-bit prime as the last element of CoeffModulus, as
         this will be used as the special prime and should be as large as the
         largest of the other primes
         (3) Choose the intermediate primes to be close to each other.
         
         We use CoeffModulus.Create to generate primes of the appropriate size. Note
         that our CoeffModulus is 200 bits total, which is below the bound for our
         PolyModulusDegree: CoeffModulus.MaxBitCount(8192) returns 218.
         */

        /*
         We choose the initial scale to be 2^40. At the last level, this leaves us
         60-40=20 bits of precision before the decimal point, and enough (roughly
         10-20 bits) of precision after the decimal point. Since our intermediate
         primes are 40 bits (in fact, they are very close to 2^40), we can achieve
         scale stabilization as described above.
