        /*
         In this examples we describe the concept of `levels' in BFV and CKKS and the
         related objects that represent them in Microsoft SEAL.
         
         In Microsoft SEAL a set of encryption parameters (excluding the random number
         generator) is identified uniquely by a 256-bit hash of the parameters. This
         hash is called the `ParmsId' and can be easily accessed and printed at any
         time. The hash will change as soon as any of the parameters is changed.
         
         When a SEALContext is created from a given EncryptionParameters instance,
         Microsoft SEAL automatically creates a so-called `modulus switching chain',
         which is a chain of other encryption parameters derived from the original set.
         The parameters in the modulus switching chain are the same as the original
         parameters with the exception that size of the coefficient modulus is
         decreasing going down the chain. More precisely, each parameter set in the
         chain attempts to remove the last coefficient modulus prime from the
         previous set this continues until the parameter set is no longer valid
         (e.g., PlainModulus is larger than the remaining CoeffModulus). It is easy
         to walk through the chain and access all the parameter sets. Additionally,
         each parameter set in the chain has a `chain index' that indicates its
         position in the chain so that the last set has index 0. We say that a set
         of encryption parameters, or an object carrying those encryption parameters,
         is at a higher level in the chain than another set of parameters if its the
         chain index is bigger, i.e., it is earlier in the chain.
         
         Each set of parameters in the chain involves unique pre-computations performed
         when the SEALContext is created, and stored in a SEALContext.ContextData
         object. The chain is basically a linked list of SEALContext.ContextData
         objects, and can easily be accessed through the SEALContext at any time. Each
         node can be identified by the ParmsId of its specific encryption parameters
         (PolyModulusDegree remains the same but CoeffModulus varies).
         */
        let parms = ASLEncryptionParameters(schemeType: .BFV)
        let polyModulusDegree = 8192
        try parms.setPolynomialModulusDegree(polyModulusDegree)
        
        /*
         In this example we use a custom CoeffModulus, consisting of 5 primes of
         sizes 50, 30, 30, 50, and 50 bits. Note that this is still OK according to
         the explanation in `1_BFV_Basics.cs'. Indeed,
         
         CoeffModulus.MaxBitCount(polyModulusDegree)
         
         returns 218 (greater than 50+30+30+50+50=210).
         
         Due to the modulus switching chain, the order of the 5 primes is significant.
         The last prime has a special meaning and we call it the `special prime'. Thus,
         the first parameter set in the modulus switching chain is the only one that
         involves the special prime. All key objects, such as SecretKey, are created
         at this highest level. All data objects, such as Ciphertext, can be only at
         lower levels. The special modulus should be as large as the largest of the
         other primes in the CoeffModulus, although this is not a strict requirement.
